        <p>Something excited happened. I began my first programming blog post. This is not my first blog, but it is my first blog that is done using my scant bit of programming knowledge. Cool! </p>

        <p>Well it's been about 30 minutes or more since my last post, and I have to say I am feeling pretty stoked on this CSS knowledge. So far, I have changed a few things about how this blog post looks, like the color and fonts, and like how much character it is taking on. Looking forward to seein how this continues to develop. </p>
